- `YES_EXT_HOBO.csv` - External temperature readings for Yessabah to produce Figure 1.
- `YES_END_HOBO.csv` - Internal cave temperature readings for Yessabah to produce Figure 1.

**Code**
- `DArT_filtering.R` - Code to load, filter, and clean SNP data to export as Concatenated SNP Alignment for IQTREE analysis with +ASC

**Files**
- Miniopterus_orianae_oceanensis - Contains shape files of *Miniopterus orianae oceanensis* extent distribution from [BatMap](https://www.ausbats.org.au/batmap.html) to produce Figure 1.
